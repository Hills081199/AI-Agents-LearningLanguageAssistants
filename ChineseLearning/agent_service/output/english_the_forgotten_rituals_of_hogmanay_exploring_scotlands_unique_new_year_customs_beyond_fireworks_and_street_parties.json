  "story": "# Story (English)  \nHogmanay, Scotland’s unique New Year celebration, is known worldwide for its vibrant fireworks and lively street parties, especially in cities like Edinburgh. However, many traditional rituals associated with Hogmanay have been forgotten or overshadowed by modern festivities. These customs, which have been practiced for centuries, offer a fascinating insight into Scotland’s rich cultural heritage. Exploring these rituals helps us appreciate Hogmanay beyond the usual loud celebrations.\n\nOne of the most important Hogmanay traditions is *first-footing*. This custom involves being the first person to cross a friend’s or neighbour’s threshold after midnight. According to superstition, the kind of person who arrives first influences the luck of the household for the new year. Traditionally, a tall, dark-haired male bearing gifts such as coal, shortbread, or whisky is considered to bring good fortune. This practice has been maintained in many Scottish communities and reveals the close ties between neighbours during Hogmanay.\n\nAnother lesser-known ritual is the *saining*, which is a blessing ceremony intended to protect the home and family from harm in the year ahead. In the past, families would sprinkle ‘magic’ water from the river, use burning juniper branches to fumigate each room, and recite protective prayers. Although saining is not as common today, some rural areas still observe it, highlighting the ancestral significance Hogmanay has beyond mere celebration.\n\nAdditionally, Hogmanay has historically included *processions* called \"the Hawick Common Riding,\" where riders parade horses through town to mark an old victory and protect communal lands. This tradition, which takes place in the Borders region, combines merrymaking with a strong sense of community identity. It emphasises that Hogmanay was also a time for remembering local history and showing respect for the past.\n\nOne cannot discuss Hogmanay without mentioning the famous song *Auld Lang Syne*, which is sung at the stroke of midnight across Scotland and many English-speaking countries. This song, which was written by Robert Burns, is not only a festive tune but symbolizes friendship and the remembrance of times gone by. It serves as a collective moment of reflection for people as they welcome the new year.\n\nScotland has maintained many of these unique Hogmanay customs despite the influence of modern global New Year celebrations. While fireworks and parties draw large crowds, the forgotten rituals remind us that festivals often carry deep cultural and historical meaning. By understanding and respecting these ancient practices, people can connect more deeply with Scotland’s heritage and the spirit of renewal that Hogmanay represents.\n\n# Key Expressions  \n- **Hogmanay**: The Scottish word for New Year’s Eve and the celebration surrounding it.  \n- **First-footing**: A Hogmanay tradition where the first visitor to a home after midnight brings gifts and good luck.  \n- **Superstition**: A widely held but irrational belief, often relating to luck or the supernatural.  \n- **Saining**: A traditional Scottish blessing ceremony to protect people and homes from harm.  \n- **Merrymaking**: The act of enjoying oneself with lively festivities or celebrations.  \n- **Procession**: A group of people moving forward in an organized way as part of a ceremony.  \n- **Ancestral**: Relating to family members from the past or earlier generations.  \n- **Auld Lang Syne**: A traditional Scottish song sung at midnight on New Year’s Eve, meaning “old long since” or “times gone by.”  \n- **Threshold**: The entrance or doorway of a building.  \n- **Collective moment**: An event shared by a group of people together.  \n- **Heritage**: The traditions, achievements, beliefs, etc., that are part of the history of a group or nation.",
