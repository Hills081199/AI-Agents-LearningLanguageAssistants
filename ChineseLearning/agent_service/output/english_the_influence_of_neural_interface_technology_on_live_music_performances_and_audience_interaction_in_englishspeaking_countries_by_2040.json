  "story": "# Story (English)  \nBy 2040, neural interface technology is expected to dramatically transform live music performances and the way audiences interact with artists in English-speaking countries. This innovative technology, often referred to as brain-computer interface, allows direct communication between the human brain and electronic devices. Performers will be using this technology to create fully immersive experiences that go beyond traditional concerts.\n\nIn the near future, if neural interface technology were widely adopted, concerts would become more interactive and personalized for each audience member. For example, attendees may be able to feel the emotions and creative intentions of the musicians through real-time neural feedback. This level of engagement will make live performances more captivating, as the line between performers and their fans becomes blurred. By 2040, audiences will have experienced a deeper connection with artists, not just through sound and visuals but through shared mental and emotional states.\n\nThe impact of this technology on audience interaction will also be profound. Imagine concerts where people can respond to music through brain signals, influencing how songs progress or change in rhythm and mood. Performers will be able to anticipate crowd reactions and tailor their shows spontaneously, creating unique renditions each night. By that time, music venues will have integrated neural interface systems that track and adapt to the energy of the crowd continuously.\n\nHowever, such innovations raise hypothetical concerns about privacy and the ethics of sharing brain data during live shows. If neural data were not securely protected, it could be misused or exploited. Despite these challenges, many predict that the benefits will far outweigh potential risks. Neural interfaces might also allow people with disabilities to enjoy live music in ways that were once impossible, promoting inclusivity in the entertainment industry.\n\nOverall, the arrival of neural interface technology by 2040 will revolutionize live music, making concerts an immersive and interactive experience like never before. While it is difficult to predict every detail, it is clear that this technology will have a major impact on both performers and audiences. If these advancements continue to develop, music lovers can look forward to a future where music connects people on a deeper, more meaningful level than ever before.\n\n# Key Expressions  \n- Neural interface technology: A system that connects the human brain directly with machines or computers.  \n- Brain-computer interface: Another term for technology that allows communication between the brain and electronic devices.  \n- Immersive experience: A situation or event that deeply engages the senses or emotions, making a person feel part of it.  \n- Fully immersive experiences: Complete and intense involvement in an event, often involving multiple forms of sensory feedback.  \n- Real-time neural feedback: Instant information received from brain activity, used to influence or adjust something immediately.  \n- Engagement: The level of interest, attention, and emotional involvement a person has in an activity.  \n- Profound impact: A significant and deep effect.  \n- Hypothetical concerns: Possible worries based on imagined or theoretical situations.  \n- Inclusivity: The practice of including people of all abilities and backgrounds.  \n- Revolutionize: To dramatically change something in an important and fundamental way.",
