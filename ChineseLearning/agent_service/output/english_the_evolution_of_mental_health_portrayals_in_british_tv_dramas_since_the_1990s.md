### III. Grammar Points  
1. **Past Perfect vs. Simple Past**  
   - To describe the sequence of events when discussing changes in the portrayal of mental health over time (e.g., "By the late 1990s, TV dramas had already started to show more complex characters struggling with mental illness.")  
   - Helps express what had happened before a certain point in the past and what happened subsequently.

2. **Conditionals – Second Conditional (Hypothetical situations)**  
   - To speculate about how TV portrayals might influence society or how changes could have been different (e.g., "If British TV dramas did not show mental health issues sensitively, stigma would probably have continued to grow.")  
   - Encourages use of sophisticated structures to discuss possible outcomes and societal effects.

This structured approach ensures students practice both thematic vocabulary and grammatical accuracy while engaging deeply with a culturally relevant and unique topic in the Movies & TV domain.

## Story

# Story (English)  
Since the 1990s, the portrayal of mental health in British TV dramas has undergone a remarkable transformation. In earlier decades, mental illness was often shown in a very simplified or negative way. Characters with mental health problems were usually presented as dangerous or unpredictable, which reinforced social stigma and stereotypes. These early representations sometimes lacked depth and failed to explore the true experiences of people living with mental health issues.

By the late 1990s, however, TV dramas had already started to change their approach. Writers and producers began to create more complex characters who struggled with various mental health challenges. Instead of being mere villains or comic relief, these characters became central to the storyline. For example, some dramas showed protagonists grappling with depression or anxiety, allowing viewers to see sensitive and realistic portrayals of these conditions. This shift helped increase public awareness and understanding, breaking down many taboos around mental illness.

Throughout the 2000s and into the 2010s, the representation of mental health on British television grew even more nuanced. Dramas explored a wide range of conditions such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, often highlighting the difficulties faced by patients and their families. Character development became a key focus, with stories showing how people cope and sometimes recover over time. This kind of portrayal encouraged empathy and helped reduce stigma by presenting mental health as a normal part of human life rather than something shameful or frightening.

If British TV dramas had not taken a more sensitive and realistic approach, the stigma around mental illness might have continued to grow unchecked. By showing mental health issues honestly and with depth, these shows played a part in fostering a society where people could talk more openly about their struggles. Additionally, the improved narratives allowed mental health professionals and patients to feel seen and respected in popular culture.

Looking forward, the portrayal of mental health in British dramas remains an important topic. If future programs continue to offer thoughtful and accurate depictions, they will not only entertain but also educate audiences. This could lead to further reduction in stigma and more support for those affected by mental illness. The evolution of these portrayals over the past thirty years reflects a broader cultural shift toward empathy and awareness, showing how powerful media can be in shaping attitudes and encouraging social change.

# Key Expressions

- **Stigma** – the negative attitudes society holds against people with mental illness.

- **Complex characters** – characters with many layers, showing real emotions and challenges.  
- **Sensitive portrayal** – showing mental health issues with care and respect, understanding people’s feelings.  
- **Representation** – how mental health is depicted on TV, influencing how viewers think about it.  
- **Awareness** – understanding and knowledge about mental health issues.  
- **Taboo** – a subject that people tend to avoid talking about because it is uncomfortable or socially unacceptable.  
- **Narrative** – the story told by the drama, including how mental health is included.  
- **Character development** – how a TV character changes over time, especially showing growth or struggle related to mental health.  
- **Hypothetical situation** – an imagined or “what if” situation, like “If TV dramas had not shown mental illness realistically…”
