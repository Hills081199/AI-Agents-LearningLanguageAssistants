## Story

# Story (English)  
In recent years, more and more English-speaking professionals have started embracing digital detox routines. This new trend has grown as people recognize how constant connections to their devices can cause distractions and affect their mental health. A digital detox means purposely unplugging from digital devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers for a certain period. Many professionals have found that these breaks help improve their productivity and overall wellbeing.

The modern workplace often requires employees to stay online for long hours. However, this connection can become overwhelming. Constant notifications, emails, and social media updates can drain attention and increase stress levels. To counter these effects, individuals have developed habits that limit their screen time. For example, some people set specific “no device” times during the day. Others have created spaces at home where technology is not allowed. These small changes encourage mindfulness, allowing the brain to rest and refocus.

Research has shown that digital detox routines not only reduce distractions but also promote better mental health. When professionals disconnect, they experience less anxiety and feel more present in their daily activities. Many have discovered that taking time away from screens improves their sleep, mood, and creativity. Such positive changes contribute directly to better performance at work. In fact, several companies have introduced policies encouraging employees to unplug during breaks or after office hours to boost productivity.

People who have started digital detox routines often recommend that others should try it too. They argue that everyone ought to recognize the importance of balancing technology use with real-life interactions. Experts say you must set clear boundaries around device use. For example, turning off phones during meetings or before bedtime can prevent overwhelm. Additionally, practicing mindfulness techniques during tech-free times can further enhance wellbeing.

In conclusion, the rise of digital detox routines reflects a growing awareness among English-speaking professionals about their mental health and productivity. By choosing to unplug regularly, many have improved their focus and reduced stress. While technology plays a vital role in our lives, learning when to disconnect is equally important. Those who have made digital detox a habit have already noticed the positive effects, and they encourage others to do the same for a healthier, more balanced lifestyle.
