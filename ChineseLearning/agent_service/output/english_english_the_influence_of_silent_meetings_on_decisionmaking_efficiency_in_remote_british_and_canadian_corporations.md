Level: B2 (Upper-Intermediate)  

1. Learning Objectives:  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Understand and discuss the concept of silent meetings and their impact on decision-making efficiency, particularly in remote work contexts in British and Canadian corporations.  
- Use key vocabulary related to business meetings, remote work, and decision-making processes confidently and appropriately in context.  
- Form complex sentences using the second conditional and the passive voice to describe hypothetical situations and processes related to silent meetings and decision-making.  
- Develop speaking and writing skills by expressing opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of silent meetings compared to traditional meetings.

2. Key Vocabulary:  
- Silent meeting  
- Remote work  
- Decision-making  
- Efficiency  
- Collaboration  
- Productivity  
- Facilitator  
- Consensus  
- Distraction

## Story

# Story (English)  
In recent years, remote work has become a standard practice for many corporations, especially in Britain and Canada. This shift has led to new ways of conducting meetings, one of which is the silent meeting. Silent meetings are unique because participants communicate only through written messages, often using digital platforms, without speaking aloud. This format has gained attention for its potential to improve decision-making efficiency in remote teams.

Silent meetings are designed to reduce distractions and ensure that all voices are heard equally. In traditional meetings, some participants might dominate the conversation while others remain silent. However, during silent meetings, every team member contributes by typing their thoughts and ideas, which are visible to all. This method promotes transparency and allows decisions to be reviewed carefully before reaching a consensus. As a result, many British and Canadian corporations have reported increased productivity and quicker decision-making since adopting silent meetings.

One significant advantage of silent meetings is that they encourage reflection. Since participants cannot interrupt each other, they have time to think deeply about the issues discussed. If corporations adopted more silent meetings, decision-making might become more efficient because decisions would be based on thoughtful analysis rather than immediate reactions. Moreover, silent meetings are often structured so that a facilitator guides the process, ensuring that discussions stay on track and all relevant points are considered.

On the other hand, some challenges have been observed during silent meetings. For example, the lack of verbal cues can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. When body language and tone of voice are absent, it might be harder to interpret the meaning behind certain messages. Additionally, some individuals may find it difficult to express themselves clearly in writing, which could affect collaboration. Despite these concerns, many companies believe that these drawbacks can be managed with proper training and clear guidelines.

In British and Canadian remote corporations, silent meetings are increasingly being used alongside traditional meetings to balance efficiency with personal interaction. Decisions were made more quickly during the silent meetings last quarter in several companies, showing the method’s effectiveness. However, if silent meetings were used exclusively, some collaboration aspects might suffer. Therefore, a combination of both formats may be the most practical approach.

To sum up, silent meetings have had a notable influence on decision-making efficiency in remote British and Canadian corporations. They minimize distractions, promote equal participation, and allow careful consideration of ideas. If more companies embraced silent meetings, remote work could become even more productive. Nevertheless, achieving the right balance between silent and spoken communication remains crucial to maintaining strong collaboration and successful decision outcomes.
