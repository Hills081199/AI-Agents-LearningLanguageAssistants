## Story

# Story (Hanzi)  
近年来，随着中国社会的发展和互联网的普及，新的网络用语不断出现，其中“内卷”一词引起了广泛的关注和讨论。最初，“内卷”是一个学术术语，意思是在有限的资源和空间内，系统内部的竞争越来越激烈，却没有产生相应的进步或创新。渐渐地，这个词被年轻人在网络上用来形容现实生活中过度的竞争压力和无意义的努力。

内卷现象在中国社会中越来越普遍，尤其是在教育、职场和生活的各个方面。比如，在学校里，学生们为了考更好的成绩，参加更多辅导班，花费大量时间学习，导致压力巨大；在职场上，许多人加班加点，争夺有限的晋升机会，感觉永远无法放松。这种竞争虽然激烈，却往往没有真正的成果或改变，反而让人感到疲惫和迷茫。

过度的内卷导致很多人开始抱怨生活变得很压抑，甚至影响心理健康。社会上有声音呼吁，要找到解决内卷现象的方法，比如减少不必要的竞争，注重个人兴趣和发展。然而，内卷现象的形成与社会文化和经济发展有很大关系，要彻底解决并不容易。内卷提醒我们应该反思生活的意义和方式，学会在竞争中寻找平衡。

总的来说，“内卷”这一网络流行语，反映了当代中国年轻人在快速变化的社会中面临的压力和挑战。理解和讨论内卷，不仅能帮助我们认识社会现象，还能促进我们思考如何减少压力，过上更有质量的生活。

# Translation  
In recent years, with the development of Chinese society and the popularization of the internet, new internet slang words have constantly appeared. Among them, the term “neijuan” has attracted wide attention and discussion. Originally, “neijuan” was an academic term meaning that within limited resources and space, competition inside a system becomes increasingly intense but does not produce corresponding progress or innovation. Gradually, this word was used by young people online to describe the excessive competitive pressure and meaningless efforts in real life.

The phenomenon of neijuan has become increasingly common in Chinese society, especially in education, workplaces, and various aspects of life. For example, in schools, students take more tutoring classes and spend a lot of time studying for better grades, leading to huge pressure; in the workplace, many people work overtime to compete for limited promotion opportunities, feeling they can never relax. Although this competition is fierce, it often does not result in real achievements or changes, but rather makes people feel tired and confused.

Excessive neijuan has caused many people to start complaining that life has become very stressful, even affecting mental health. There are voices in society calling for solutions to the neijuan phenomenon, such as reducing unnecessary competition and focusing on personal interests and development. However, the formation of neijuan is closely related to social culture and economic development, so completely solving it is not easy. Neijuan reminds us to reflect on the meaning and way of life and to learn how to find balance amid competition.

In summary, the internet buzzword “neijuan” reflects the pressure and challenges faced by young people in rapidly changing contemporary Chinese society. Understanding and discussing neijuan not only helps us recognize social phenomena but also encourages us to think about how to reduce stress and live a higher-quality life.
