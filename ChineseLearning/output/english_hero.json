  "story": "# Story (English)  \nA hero is someone who shows courage and integrity, often at great personal risk. Heroes can be found in many places and in many forms. Sometimes they are famous people whose stories we hear on the news, and other times they are ordinary individuals whose brave actions might never become legendary but are just as admirable. The definition of a hero is not always simple, because what makes someone a hero can depend on the situation and culture. However, common traits like self-sacrifice, resilience, and compassion are always important.\n\nOne inspiring story happened a few years ago in a small town. A young woman named Emily was walking home from work when she saw thick smoke coming from a nearby house. Someone might have already called the fire department, but Emily didn’t wait. She ran towards the burning building. She could have stayed safe, but she decided to act quickly. Emily must have been very brave because the fire was dangerous, and the smoke made it difficult to see or breathe. Inside the house, she found an elderly man who was trapped and unable to move easily. Without hesitation, Emily helped him out, protecting him from the flames and smoke. Thanks to her quick thinking and courage, no one was hurt that day.\n\nEmily could be seen as a role model because of her selflessness and compassion. Her story teaches us that heroism isn’t only about strength or physical power; it is also about doing what is right, even when it is hard. Being a hero might mean putting others before yourself and showing resilience in the face of danger. Sometimes heroes are famous for their achievements, but most heroes are ordinary people who act bravely when others need help.\n\nWe might wonder why Emily acted so quickly. She must have had a deep sense of responsibility and kindness. It’s possible she thought about what could happen if she did nothing, and she couldn’t accept that. Her actions inspire us to consider how we can help others in our own lives. After all, heroism is not limited to big or dramatic moments – sometimes small acts of kindness and bravery make a huge difference. The world needs more people like Emily, who show that anyone can be a hero.\n\n# Key Expressions  \n- **Courage and integrity** – showing bravery and strong moral principles.  \n- **Self-sacrifice** – giving up one’s own safety or comfort for the benefit of others.  \n- **Admirable** – deserving respect and approval.  \n- **Legendary** – famous or well-known, especially for brave or great acts.  \n- **Role model** – someone who others look up to and want to imitate.  \n- **Resilience** – the ability to recover quickly from difficulties.  \n- **Quick thinking** – the ability to make good decisions fast in difficult situations.  \n- **Must have been very brave** – modal verb + perfect tense used to deduce that someone showed bravery in the past.  \n- **Could be seen as** – a phrase used to suggest that someone might be described in a certain way.  \n- **Put others before yourself** – to care about other people’s needs more than your own.  \n- **Might have had a deep sense of responsibility** – used to speculate about someone’s feelings or motivations in the past.",
